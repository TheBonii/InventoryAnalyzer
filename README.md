# Inventory Analyzer

A simple Python script that analyzes inventory data from a `.csv` file and generates a summary report.

## Key Feature: Standard Library Only

This project was developed using **only Python's standard library**, primarily the `csv` module. It intentionally **avoids external libraries like `pandas`** to showcase fundamental data processing techniques, including:

*   File I/O and error handling (`try...except`).
*   Manual iteration and data parsing.
*   State management for calculations within a loop.

## What it does

The script reads an `inventory.csv` file with product data and performs the following analysis:

- Calculates the total number of units across all products.
- Calculates the total monetary value of the entire inventory.
- Identifies the SKU of the most expensive product by unit price.
- Identifies the SKU of the cheapest product by unit price.

The results are then written to a new file, `report.txt`.

## Project Structure

```

├── inventory.csv     # Example input data
├── README.md         # This file
├── report.txt        # The report generated by the script
└── script.py         # The main analysis script
```

## How to Use

1.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Place your data in the `inventory.csv` file, following the existing format.
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python3 script.py
    ```
4.  Check the results in the newly created `report.txt`.
